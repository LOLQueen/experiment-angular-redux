# Webpack Canvas Boilerplate

This is a simple setup that I used to play with the HTML5 `canvas` element (using `ES6`/`ES7` goodness). With the help of `webpack`'s hot module loading, this setup simply replaces the `canvas` element in the document body whenever relevant source code is changed on disk.

## Setup
To start the development server, run:
```BASH
# visit localhost:8080 
> npm start
```

To build the application, run:
```BASH
> npm run build
```

## Sources
This is largely based off Andrew's [React Redux Boilerplate](https://github.com/andrewdamelio/react-redux-boilerplate), so special thanks to him!
