Components that we need:

  - LandingPage
    - will show a form
    - no attributes

      Example:
        <landing-page></landing-page>

  - SummonerPage
    - display the summoner page header
    - display the summoner page game items

      Example:
        <summoner-page></summoner-page>

    - SummonerHeading
      - display summoner name, rank, region
      - and show when last updated (from our website)
      - display picture of some sort (maybe last champion played)

      Example:
        <summoner-heading summoner="from summoner page"></summoner-heading>

    - MatchHistory
      - display the ten most recent games played (for now)
      - a list of GameCard directives

      Example:
        <match-history history="games played"></match-history>

      - GameCard
        - display the game information from the /matches?summoner-name=blah route
        - will take in one game as an attribute

          Example:
            <game-card info="game"></game-card>

  Research:
    - figure out how data will flow through our application
      - flux or traditional MVC?
      - where is state managed
